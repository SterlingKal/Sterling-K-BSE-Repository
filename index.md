# Sterling's Floor Cleaning Robot
"We dream of having a clean house â€” but who dreams of actually doing the cleaning?" -Marcus Buckingham

Let's be honest, who actually likes cleaning? With my floor cleaning robot, you'll never have to clean the house again...at least not the floors!

# My First Milestone
Where to begin? Well, before we can even begin discussing making my robot clean the floor, we have to actually build the robot! My first major goal was to finish building the base of the robot. I am going to refer to this base as the "car" since that's basically what my robot's base is.

My first step was to wire the car and this was _painfully_ slow. My car has four motors, with one being utilized for each wheel. To wire my car, I had to attach one red wire and one black wire to each motor by wrapping them around two miniature hooks. I then had to fasten the motors in place with screws and hex nuts. The process was "painful" because my wires would keep falling out of the holes they were wrapped around, so I had to continously unscre the motors from their place, re-wire the motors, and then re-screw them back into place.

Once I was finished with the main part of the wiring, I fastened the roof of the car into place by attaching it with the base via mini support beam. Afterwwards, I slid my wires through two holes on the roof of the car. I tied two pairs of red wires together as well as two pairs of black wires together. Next, I hot glued my battery pack and motor driver onto the roof of the car. It was then time to wire the top of the car.

I inserted a pair of red wires into the "OUT1" and "OUT4" connections of the motor driver and a pair of black wires into the "OUT2" and "OUT3" connections of the motor driver. I then connected six multi-colored wires to my ESP32 microcontroller. Finally, after applying wheels onto the car, I plugged in the microcontroller to my computer, ran a piece of sample code in Arduino to mensure that I wired my car correctly, and watched the car rotate left and right.
